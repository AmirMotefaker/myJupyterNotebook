# Rain Prediction in Australia

Project Scenario

This is Honors Project. Its completion is optional but highly recommended.

Now that you have been equipped with the skills to use different Machine Learning algorithms over the course of five weeks, you will have the opportunity to practice and apply it on a dataset. In this project, you will complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether there will be rain the following day.

For your project, you will use a rainfall dataset from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology , clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. 

- Alternatively, you can download your data from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/


You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM


The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics, when these are applicable:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score




>>>I am implementing a forecasting model on the Rain Dataset to predict whether it will rain in Australia tomorrow. The dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from various locations in Australia.



### Step by Step:

      1. Splitting the dataset into training and testing data for regression

      2. Building and training a model using Linear Regression and calculating evaluation metrics

      3. Creating a final regression report/table of evaluation metrics

      4. Building and training a model using KNN and calculating evaluation metrics

      5. Building and training a model using Decision Trees and calculating evaluation metrics

      6. Building and training a model using Logistic Regression and calculating evaluation metrics

      7. Building and training a model using SVM and calculating evaluation metrics

      8. Creating a final classification report/table of evaluation metrics
