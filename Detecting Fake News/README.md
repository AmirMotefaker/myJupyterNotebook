# Detecting Fake News using ML

## What is Fake News?

- A type of yellow journalism, fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread through social media and other online media. 
- This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas. 
- Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims and may end up being virtualized by algorithms, and users may end up in a filter bubble.
